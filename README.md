# A Star-demonstration
A p5.js sketch visualizing the A* pathfinding algorithm on a 2D grid. Users set start and end points, place or remove obstacles, and observe how the algorithm searches for the shortest path.  Supports diagonal movement, choice between Euclidean and Manhattan heuristics, and both step-by-step or automatic execution for educational exploration.
